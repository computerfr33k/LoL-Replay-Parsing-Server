This is the official website for my LoL Replay Server project.

I am currently developing this on my spare time. Development will not be happening too fast of a pace, but it is still happening and I could also use some help if anyone is interested.

To help out, just send a pull request and if I like it, I will merge it into the main branch. Any code or even bug reports are helpful in helping with development.
