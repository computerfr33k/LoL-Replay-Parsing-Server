### Server
This is a League of Legends Replay Server that will parse a replay that is uploaded to it (Rofl & Lrf). The server also saves the uploaded replays into a folder which allows it to then accept a client requesting info about a specified match id and will send back the match info if it has a matching replay file uploaded.

### Client
I have also included a work in progress client example that shows what is possible to do with the server in terms of building a client program to use it. This server could be useful for making a website that shows match info for replays uploaded & could allow people to then share it with their friends kind of like the official LoL match site.
